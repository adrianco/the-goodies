"""
Inbetweenies Protocol - Smart Home Data Models

STATUS: âœ… Production Ready - All models tested and operational

ARCHITECTURE:
SQLAlchemy models for The Goodies smart home knowledge graph system
supporting both modern Entity-based architecture and legacy HomeKit
compatibility for seamless migration and integration.

CORE MODELS:
- Entity: Universal smart home entity (devices, rooms, homes, etc.)
- EntityRelationship: Connections between entities with typed relationships
- Home/Room/Accessory: HomeKit-compatible legacy models
- Service/Characteristic: Device capability modeling
- User: Access control and user management
- SyncMetadata: Client synchronization state tracking

ENTITY TYPES:
HOME, ROOM, DEVICE, ZONE, DOOR, WINDOW, PROCEDURE, MANUAL, NOTE, 
SCHEDULE, AUTOMATION - comprehensive smart home entity coverage

RELATIONSHIP TYPES:
LOCATED_IN, CONTROLS, MONITORS, PART_OF, DEPENDS_ON, SIMILAR_TO -
flexible entity interconnection modeling

KEY FEATURES:
- Immutable versioning with complete audit trail
- Full-text search capabilities across all entity content
- Backward compatibility with HomeKit models
- Graph operations with relationship traversal
- Content field for flexible device-specific data storage

PRODUCTION READY:
All models successfully handle entity storage, relationships,
and synchronization with comprehensive test coverage.
