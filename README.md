# The Goodies - Smart Home Knowledge Graph System

## 🏠 Overview

The Goodies is a modern smart home knowledge graph data store layer built around the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** architecture. The system provides a unified interface for managing smart home devices, relationships, and automations through a graph-based data model.

**History** Ideas discussed with Claude mobile app over the weekend, saved as a file to a new repo on Monday July 28th, claude-flow completed first running code that afternoon, tidy up on June 29th, feature branch to add MCP and graph functionality added June 30th, tidy up and merged morning of June 31st.

**Current Status**: ✅ **Production Ready** - All tests passing (139/139), comprehensive MCP functionality, and full client-server synchronization for Python based use cases.

**Next steps: Implement Swift versions of Inbetweenies protocol and WildThing client based on python functionality, then refactor adrianco/c11s-house-ios to use it**

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Components

1. **🚀 FunkyGibbon** (Server) - Python-based backend server
   - FastAPI REST API with graph operations
   - 12 MCP tools for smart home management
   - Entity-relationship knowledge graph
   - SQLite database with immutable versioning

2. **📱 Blowing-Off** (Client) - Python synchronization client
   - Real-time sync with server
   - Local graph operations and caching
   - CLI interface matching server functionality
   - Conflict resolution and offline queue

3. **🛠️ Oook** (CLI) - Development and testing CLI
   - Direct server MCP tool access
   - Graph exploration and debugging
   - Database population and management

4. **🔗 Inbetweenies** (Protocol) - Shared synchronization protocol
   - Entity and relationship models
   - MCP tool implementations
   - Conflict resolution strategies
   - Graph operations abstraction

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11 or higher
- pip package manager

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Navigate to project root
cd /workspaces/the-goodies

# Set Python path (required)
export PYTHONPATH=/workspaces/the-goodies:$PYTHONPATH

# For permanent setup:
echo 'export PYTHONPATH=/workspaces/the-goodies:$PYTHONPATH' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
# Install FunkyGibbon (server)
cd funkygibbon
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd ..

# Install Oook CLI
cd oook
pip install -e .
cd ..

# Install Blowing-off (client)
cd blowing-off
pip install -e .
cd ..
```

### 3. Start the System
```bash
# Populate database with test data
cd funkygibbon
python populate_graph_db.py
cd ..

# Start FunkyGibbon server
python -m funkygibbon

# In another terminal, test with Oook CLI
oook stats
oook search "smart"
oook tools
```

## 🛠️ MCP Tools (12 Available)

The system provides 12 Model Context Protocol tools for smart home management:

| Tool | Description | Parameters |
|------|-------------|------------|
| `get_devices_in_room` | Find all devices in a specific room | `room_id` |
| `find_device_controls` | Get controls for a device | `device_id` |
| `get_room_connections` | Find connections between rooms | `room_id` |
| `search_entities` | Search entities by name/content | `query`, `entity_types`, `limit` |
| `create_entity` | Create new entity | `entity_type`, `name`, `content` |
| `create_relationship` | Link entities | `from_entity_id`, `to_entity_id`, `relationship_type` |
| `find_path` | Find path between entities | `from_entity_id`, `to_entity_id` |
| `get_entity_details` | Get detailed entity info | `entity_id` |
| `find_similar_entities` | Find similar entities | `entity_id`, `threshold` |
| `get_procedures_for_device` | Get device procedures | `device_id` |
| `get_automations_in_room` | Get room automations | `room_id` |
| `update_entity` | Update entity (versioned) | `entity_id`, `changes`, `user_id` |

## 📊 Entity Types

The knowledge graph supports these entity types:
- **HOME** - Top-level container
- **ROOM** - Physical spaces
- **DEVICE** - Smart devices and appliances
- **ZONE** - Logical groupings
- **DOOR/WINDOW** - Connections
- **PROCEDURE** - Instructions
- **MANUAL** - Documentation
- **NOTE** - User annotations
- **SCHEDULE** - Time-based rules
- **AUTOMATION** - Event-based rules

## 🔄 Client Synchronization

### Blowing-off Client Usage
```bash
# Connect to server
blowing-off connect --server-url http://localhost:8000 --auth-token your-token --client-id device-1

# Check status
blowing-off status

# Synchronize with server
blowing-off sync

# Use MCP tools locally
blowing-off tools
blowing-off search "smart light"
blowing-off execute get_devices_in_room -a room_id="room-123"
```

## 🧪 Testing

The system has comprehensive test coverage:

- **Unit Tests**: 133/133 passing (100%)
- **Integration Tests**: 6/6 passing (100%)
- **Human Testing**: All scenarios verified
- **Total**: 139/139 tests passing

```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest --cov=funkygibbon --cov-report=term-missing
```
