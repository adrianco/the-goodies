# IGNORE THIS FILE

# Keep notes on what prompts have been used for claude-flow

hive mind created with Objective: 
review the plan in homegraph_mcp_library_initial.md and the plans in related project github.com/adrianco/c11s-ios-house/plans which haven't been implemented yet. Write detailed step 
  by step plans in a new /plans directory for how to build and test this system, including a pull request against c11s-house-ios/plans that details how to interface to the finished 
  the-goodies/WildThing MCP service, don't start creating project structure or code files yet, just plans ready for review and refinement


claude-flow alpha swarm bug - can't find analyst agent-type
do not use the 'coordinator' agent-type use the 'adaptiv-coordinator' (or hierarchical-coordinator or mesh-coordinator)
do not use 'analyst' use 'code-analyzer'
do not use 'architect' use 'system-architect'

> do not use the 'analyst' agent-type, use code-analyzer

● I'll correct the agent type and continue with the swarm orchestration using the proper agent types.


Objective: simplify the plans, the system only needs to support one house with a few hundred entities, a handful of users, and a low update rate. Use sqlite everywhere with last write wins and timestamps. 
  re-sequence the work to build all the python code first making sure it all works, before building the Swift/WildThing code


  > I see code in directories - tests and FunkyGibbon/tests and funkygibbon/tests - please clean up the directory structure and implement the remaining tests for Python functionality. Create a document that summarizes
   what the tests do and the test results

   > tidy up the .md files so that the documentation littering the root directory is put in appropriate spaces. Append to the top level README with links to documentation. Move any obsolete .md files to plans/archive

modify the plans to document, create and test a client implementation of the protocol in Python for test purposes, with the same functionality as the eventual Swift/WildThing code will have, called blowing-off and
   implement the Inbetweenies protocol to synchronize updates between them.


   update all source code files with a comprehensive block comment at the start that summarizes their development context, what they do, why and maintain bugs and revision history. This makes future edits more 
  reliable, remember to create context blocks in any new files and to update them when code is changed

Day 2 - July 29th
look at human test results in error-logs.txt and tidy up the system

Got all tests working and everything tidy


 I've created and pushed the feature/next-phase branch. You're now working on this feature branch, which will keep your changes separate from main until you're ready to merge them.

next phase instructions are in plans/homegraph_mcp_library_initial_plan.md and plans/homegraph_analysis_summary.md, pay attention to comments marked as TODO: and create new documents in plans directory that detail how to incrementally migrate this fully tested code base to add the homegraph features step by step



✻ Thinking…

  The user has provided a very detailed hive mind collective intelligence system prompt. They want me to:

  1. Initialize a swarm with specific worker types (researcher, coder, analyst, tester)
  2. The objective is to read plans/homegraph_mcp_library_initial_plan.md and plans/homegraph_analysis_summary.md
  3. Pay attention to TODO comments
  4. Create new documents in the plans directory that detail how to incrementally migrate the codebase to add homegraph features

  I need to:
  1. First read the two plan documents to understand the context
  2. Initialize the swarm as requested
  3. Coordinate the collective intelligence to analyze and create migration plans

  Let me start by reading those two plan documents to understand what we're working with.

● I'll begin by reading the plan documents to understand the objectives, then initialize the hive mind to create the incremental migration strategy.

● Read(plans/homegraph_mcp_library_initial_plan.md)
  ⎿  Read 1473 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Read(plans/homegraph_analysis_summary.md)
  ⎿  Read 244 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Now I have a good understanding of the project goals. The user wants me to create detailed incremental migration plans for adding homegraph features to their existing tested codebase. Based on the
   TODO comments and analysis, I need to:

  1. First understand the current codebase structure to see what already exists
  2. Create migration plan documents in the plans directory
  3. Focus on incremental steps to add homegraph features
  4. Pay attention to TODO comments in the documents

  Let me first explore the current codebase structure to understand what's already implemented.

● Now let me examine the current codebase structure to understand what's already been implemented before initializing the hive mind:

after reading the plans:
revise plans/phase2-graph-operations-migration.md and related docs there is no need for migration or backward compatibility as this is a new system, just need to update tests"
