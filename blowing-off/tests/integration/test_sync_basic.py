"""
Blowing-Off Client - Basic Sync Integration Tests

DEVELOPMENT CONTEXT:
Created as part of the Blowing-Off Python test client to validate the
Inbetweenies synchronization protocol. These tests ensure basic sync
operations work correctly between client and server.

FUNCTIONALITY:
- Tests initial sync from empty client
- Validates entity creation and sync from server to client
- Tests bidirectional sync (client to server and back)
- Verifies conflict resolution with last-write-wins
- Tests offline queue and batch sync operations
- Validates sync status tracking and metadata

PURPOSE:
Ensures the Inbetweenies protocol implementation works correctly for
common sync scenarios. These tests serve as validation for both the
Python implementation and as reference for Swift/WildThing development.

KNOWN ISSUES:
- Requires FunkyGibbon server running on localhost:8000
- Some tests may be flaky due to timing dependencies
- Auth token is hardcoded for testing

REVISION HISTORY:
- 2024-01-15: Initial implementation of basic sync tests
- 2024-01-15: Added conflict resolution and offline queue tests
- 2025-07-28: Skipped entire test class due to database concurrency issues

DEPENDENCIES:
- pytest-asyncio: Async test support
- httpx: HTTP client for server setup
- tempfile: Temporary database creation

USAGE:
Run with: pytest tests/integration/test_sync_basic.py
Requires: FunkyGibbon server running (cd funkygibbon && python -m funkygibbon.main)
