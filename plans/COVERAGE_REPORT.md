2. `test_database_migration.py::test_populate_db_with_new_schema` - Population issue
3. `test_server_startup.py::test_server_starts_and_responds` - Server startup issue

These failures are likely due to the removal of HomeKit models and need updating.

### 3. Inbetweenies Library (0% Coverage)

**Status**: No test directory exists

This is the shared protocol library that both client and server depend on. It's critical for system interoperability but has no tests.

**Components Requiring Tests:**
- `models/` - Entity, EntityRelationship, base models
- `sync/` - Protocol implementation, conflict resolution
- `graph/` - Graph operations interface
- `mcp/` - MCP tools and base classes
- `repositories/` - Repository interfaces

## Recent Changes Impact

### HomeKit Model Removal
The recent removal of HomeKit-specific models in favor of a pure graph-based approach has:
- Removed 7 obsolete test files from FunkyGibbon that were importing HomeKit models
- Simplified the architecture to use only Entity/EntityRelationship models
- Reduced code complexity but left some tests failing

### Files Removed:
- `funkygibbon/tests/unit/test_model_serialization.py`
- `funkygibbon/tests/unit/test_models.py`
- `funkygibbon/tests/unit/test_property_based.py`
- `funkygibbon/tests/unit/test_repositories.py`
- `funkygibbon/tests/integration/test_api.py`
- `funkygibbon/tests/integration/test_end_to_end.py`
- `funkygibbon/tests/integration/test_sync.py`

## Critical Issues to Address

### Immediate Priority
1. **Fix Failing Tests**: 3 tests in FunkyGibbon need updating for new architecture
2. **Inbetweenies Tests**: Create test suite for shared library (0% coverage)
3. **Authentication Coverage**: Only 21% in blowing-off auth.py
4. **Search Engine**: Only 16% coverage in FunkyGibbon

### Medium Priority
1. **MCP Implementation**: Low coverage in both client (31%) and server (22%)
2. **Database Operations**: Low coverage in base repositories (~25%)
3. **Sync Conflict Resolution**: 48% coverage needs improvement
4. **Graph Implementation**: 19% coverage in graph_impl.py

### Low Priority (Cleanup)
1. Remove `blowing-off/cli/main_old.py` (obsolete)
2. Remove `blowing-off/repositories/base_homekit.py` (obsolete)
3. Clean up unused seed/populate scripts

## Recommendations

### 1. Create Inbetweenies Test Suite
```bash
mkdir -p /workspaces/the-goodies/inbetweenies/tests/unit
mkdir -p /workspaces/the-goodies/inbetweenies/tests/integration
touch /workspaces/the-goodies/inbetweenies/tests/__init__.py
touch /workspaces/the-goodies/inbetweenies/tests/conftest.py
```

### 2. Fix Failing FunkyGibbon Tests
The 3 failing tests need updates to work with the new graph-based architecture:
- Update database migration tests
- Fix server startup test expectations

### 3. Improve Critical Component Coverage
Focus on components with <50% coverage that are critical:
- Authentication and authorization
- MCP tool implementation
- Search functionality
- Base repository operations

### 4. Testing Standards
- Minimum 80% coverage for new code
- 100% coverage for security-critical components
- Integration tests for all API endpoints
- End-to-end tests for critical workflows

- [ ] CI/CD pipeline setup

## Metrics Goals

### 30-Day Target
- Overall repository: 70% coverage
- Critical components: 85% coverage
- Zero failing tests
- Inbetweenies: 50% coverage

### 60-Day Target
- Overall repository: 80% coverage
- All components: >60% coverage
- Full CI/CD pipeline
- Performance benchmarks established

## Conclusion

The repository has a reasonable foundation with 60% and 53% coverage in the main projects, but critical gaps exist:

1. **Inbetweenies has no tests** - This shared library is critical and needs immediate attention
2. **3 tests are failing** - Need updates for the new graph-based architecture
3. **Authentication has low coverage** - Security-critical component at only 21%
4. **Search and MCP need work** - Core functionality with <25% coverage

The recent architectural change from HomeKit models to pure graph-based approach has simplified the codebase but requires test updates. Addressing these gaps is essential for production readiness.
