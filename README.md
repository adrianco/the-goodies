The Goodies - Project Root Documentation

DEVELOPMENT CONTEXT:
Created as the main entry point for The Goodies smart home knowledge graph
system. Originally envisioned as an enterprise-scale distributed system,
later simplified to a practical single-house deployment.

DOCUMENT PURPOSE:
Provides project overview, quick start guide, and navigation to all other
documentation. First point of contact for new developers and users.

REVISION HISTORY:
- 2024-01-10: Initial creation with ambitious multi-house vision
- 2024-01-15: Simplified to single-house, added FunkyGibbon details
- 2024-01-15: Added Blowing-Off client documentation
- 2024-01-15: Updated with comprehensive documentation links

NAMING:
Named after the BBC TV comedy show "The Goodies" who had some hit singles
in the 1970s, continuing the Python (Monty Python) naming tradition.

# The Goodies

## Smart Home Knowledge Graph System

A simplified smart home system designed for single-house deployments with SQLite storage and last-write-wins conflict resolution. Built with Python (FunkyGibbon backend) and Swift (WildThing iOS/macOS) components.

### 🚀 Quick Start

#### 1. Start the Backend Server

```bash
# Install and run the Python backend
cd funkygibbon
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m funkygibbon.main

# API will be available at http://localhost:8000
# API docs at http://localhost:8000/docs
```

#### 2. Install and Use the Client

```bash
# Install the Python test client
cd blowing-off
pip install -e .

# Connect to server
blowing-off connect --server-url http://localhost:8000 --auth-token test-token

# Sync data
blowing-off sync

# View synchronized data
blowing-off house show
blowing-off device list
```

### 📋 Features

- **Simple Scale**: Designed for 1 house, ~300 entities, 3-5 users
- **SQLite Storage**: Single file database with optimizations
- **Last-Write-Wins**: Simple timestamp-based conflict resolution
- **REST API**: FastAPI-based endpoints for all entities
- **Sync Protocol**: Inbetweenies bidirectional synchronization
- **Offline Support**: Client works offline with automatic sync
- **Type Safety**: Full Python 3.11+ type hints
- **Performance**: <1s for 300 entity operations

### 🏗️ Architecture

The system consists of three main components:

1. **FunkyGibbon** (Python Backend) - REST API server with SQLite storage
2. **Blowing-Off** (Python Client) - Test client with Inbetweenies sync protocol
3. **WildThing** (Swift Package) - iOS/macOS client library (in development)

### 📝 Notes

Based on initial discussions with Claude, the system has been simplified from an enterprise-scale distributed system to a practical single-house solution. The [archived plans](plans/archive/) contain the original ambitious scope.

Naming scheme based on BBC TV comedy show The Goodies who had some "hit singles" in the 1970s, since Python is a reference to Monty Python.
