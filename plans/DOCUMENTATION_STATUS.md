## Key Information Captured

### Development Context
- Project pivot from multi-house to single-house design
- Timeline of major architectural decisions
- Rationale for technology choices

### Known Issues Documented
- FunkyGibbon: Performance optimizations needed for 300+ entities
- FunkyGibbon: Sync endpoint needs better error handling
- Blowing-Off: Hardcoded auth tokens in tests
- Blowing-Off: Some timing-dependent test flakiness

### Revision History Tracking
- All files include creation date (2024-01-15)
- Major changes documented with dates
- TODO items for future improvements

## Best Practices for Future Development

1. **Always Update Headers**: When modifying code, update the revision history
2. **Document Known Issues**: Add any bugs or limitations discovered
3. **Include Examples**: Add usage examples for complex modules
4. **Track Dependencies**: Keep dependency lists current
5. **Context Matters**: Explain WHY decisions were made, not just what

## Files Needing Headers

The following files should receive headers in future updates:
- Additional test files
- Setup and configuration files
- Build scripts
- Documentation generators

## Maintenance Guidelines

1. Review headers quarterly for accuracy
2. Update revision history for significant changes
3. Remove outdated known issues when fixed
4. Add new dependencies as introduced
5. Keep examples current with API changes
