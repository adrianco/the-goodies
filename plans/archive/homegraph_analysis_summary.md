## 10. Implementation Priority

Based on the analysis, the recommended implementation order:

1. **Core Data Models** - Foundation for everything else
2. **SQLite Storage** - Enable persistence early
3. **Basic MCP Server** - Validate tool interface
4. **Graph Operations** - Core value proposition
5. **Python Backend** - Enable cloud features
6. **Inbetweenies Sync** - Connect components
7. **HomeKit Integration** - Platform-specific value
8. **Advanced Features** - Based on user feedback

This modular approach allows for incremental development and testing while maintaining architectural integrity.
