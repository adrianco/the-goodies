- [ ] SQLite Storage implementation
- [ ] FunkyGibbon Python backend and Blowing-off front end with shared models
- [ ] Comprehensive test suite for both packages

### Phase 2: Graph Operations in Python on server (2 weeks)
- [ ] In-memory graph with relationship indexing in Python
- [ ] Path finding and traversal algorithms
- [ ] Search and query optimization
- [ ] Basic MCPServer with essential tools
- [ ] New Oook CLI tool for FunkyGibbon development and testing

### Phase 3: Inbetweenies Protocol in Python (2 weeks)
- [ ] Inbetweenies protocol specification and JSON schemas
- [ ] InbetweeniesServer implementation in FunkyGibbon
- [ ] InbetweeniesClient Python implementation in Blowing-off
- [ ] Basic sync functionality with last-write-wins conflict resolution

### Phase 4: Swift Implementation (2 weeks)
- [ ] InbetweeniesClient Swift implementation in WildThing
- [ ] HomeKit integration module (iOS/macOS)
- [ ] Matter/Thread support investigation
- [ ] Binary content storage (images, PDFs)
- [ ] Integrate into c11s-house-ios project

## 5. Integration Points

### iOS/HomeKit Integration
- handled by apps like c11s-ios-house that depend on the-goodies

### Cloud Sync Architecture
- FunkyGibbon serves as central sync hub
- Multiple WildThing clients sync via Inbetweenies
- Conflict resolution at server level
- Offline operation with full locally cached data

### MCP Integration
- Standard MCP tool interface
- JSON-RPC communication
- Async operation support
- Error handling and recovery

## 6. Gaps Requiring Detailed Planning

### Security & Authentication
- User authentication strategy - server managed passwords
- Encryption for stored device passwords
- Client apps only create and read entities, no delete or update
- Server based admin scripts to archive/compact data and delete/rollback unwanted changes

### Conflict Resolution
- Specific conflict resolution algorithms
- User interface for conflict management
- Automatic vs manual resolution policies

### Performance Optimization
- Caching strategies for large datasets
- Sync optimization for mobile networks
- Graph query performance tuning
- Memory management on constrained devices

### Error Handling
- Network failure recovery
- Data corruption recovery
- Partial sync handling
- Rollback mechanisms

### Testing Strategy
- Integration test scenarios
- Performance benchmarks
- Multi-device testing setup
- Chaos testing for sync

### Deployment & Distribution
- Swift Package Manager publication
- PyPI package publication
- CI/CD pipeline setup
- Version management strategy

## 7. Key Architectural Decisions

### Local-First Design
- WildThing operates independently without network
- Sync is optional enhancement
- Full functionality offline

### Protocol-Based Communication
- Inbetweenies protocol enables flexibility
- Multiple backend implementations possible
- Version compatibility built-in

### Graph-Based Architecture
- Entities and relationships as first-class concepts
- Efficient traversal and querying
- Natural representation of home structure

### Platform-Native Approach
- Swift for Apple platforms
- Python for server/cloud
- Each optimized for its environment

## 8. Success Criteria

### Performance Targets
- < 10ms graph queries
- < 100MB memory for 10k entities
- < 5s sync operations
- 90%+ test coverage

### Usability Goals

- Clear error messages
- Intuitive CLI tool
- Comprehensive documentation

### Scalability Requirements
- Support 10,000+ entities per home
- Handle 100+ concurrent sync clients
- Efficient delta sync
- Reliable conflict resolution

## 9. Future Enhancements

### Short Term (3-6 months)
- Natural language procedure creation
- Matter/Thread device support
- Usage analytics
- Household collaboration

### Medium Term (6-12 months)
- macOS/watchOS apps

- AI-driven automation
- Third-party integrations

### Long Term (1+ years)
- Voice integration
- Computer vision
- Predictive intelligence
- Community features

## 10. Implementation Priority

Based on the analysis, the recommended implementation order:

1. **Core Data Models** - Foundation for everything else
2. **SQLite Storage** - Enable persistence early
3. **Basic MCP Server** - Validate tool interface
4. **Graph Operations** - Core value proposition
5. **Python Backend** - Enable cloud features
6. **Inbetweenies Sync** - Connect components
7. **HomeKit Integration** - Platform-specific value
8. **Advanced Features** - Based on user feedback

This modular approach allows for incremental development and testing while maintaining architectural integrity.
