Distributed sync with conflict resolution is inherently complex and error-prone.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Primary:** Start with simple last-write-wins
2. **Secondary:** Extensive testing with edge cases
3. **Tertiary:** Manual conflict resolution UI

**Contingency Plan:**
- Week 5: Build simple sync first

**Impact:** Sync failures  
**Timeline:** Weeks 2, 5-6

**Description:**  
Swift and Python may handle data types differently, causing serialization mismatches.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Primary:** Strict JSON schema validation
2. **Secondary:** Comprehensive serialization tests
3. **Tertiary:** Type conversion layer

**Contingency Plan:**
- Define minimal type set
- Test every data type combination

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Primary:** Early prototype integration
2. **Secondary:** Parallel development tracks
3. **Tertiary:** Phased integration approach

**Contingency Plan:**
- Start integration tests Week 5
- Have fallback manual import
- Prioritize HomeKit over Matter
- Document limitations clearly

**Early Warning Signs:**
- API documentation gaps
- Unexpected platform restrictions
- Certification requirements
