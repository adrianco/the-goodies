# Blowing-Off Python Client Implementation Plan

## Overview

"Blowing-off" is a Python test client that implements the same functionality as the eventual Swift/WildThing code. It serves as:
- A validation tool for the FunkyGibbon server
- A test harness for the Inbetweenies sync protocol
- A reference implementation for Swift development

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Local SQLite Storage**
   - Mirror of server-side schema
   - Local-only fields for sync tracking
   - Conflict tracking and resolution

2. **Client Models**
   - Same entities as server using Inbetweenies shared models
   - HomeKit-compatible models (Home, Room, Accessory, Service, Characteristic, User)
   - Additional sync metadata (last_sync, sync_status, local_changes)
   - Client-side caching strategies

3. **Sync Engine**
   - Inbetweenies protocol implementation
   - Bidirectional sync with conflict resolution
   - Offline operation support
   - Batch synchronization

4. **Client API**
   - Async/await interface matching Swift patterns
   - Observable properties for UI binding
   - Local-first operations with background sync

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Local Storage (Week 3, Day 1-2)
- SQLite schema with sync metadata
- Client models with local tracking
- Repository pattern for data access
- Local CRUD operations

### Phase 2: Sync Protocol (Week 3, Day 3-4)
- Inbetweenies protocol client
- Sync state machine
- Conflict detection and resolution
- Batch sync operations

### Phase 3: Client Interface (Week 3, Day 5)
- Python API matching Swift interface
- CLI for testing operations
- Observable pattern for changes
- Background sync tasks

### Phase 4: Testing & Validation (Week 4, Day 1-2)
- Integration tests with FunkyGibbon
- Sync scenario testing
- Performance benchmarks
- Conflict resolution validation

## Client-Specific Features

### Offline Support
- Queue local changes when offline
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Conflict resolution on reconnect
- Local-first data access

### Sync Optimization
- Delta sync for efficiency
- Compression for large payloads
- Batching for multiple changes
- Smart polling intervals

### Client State Management
- Sync status tracking
- Connection state monitoring
- Error recovery mechanisms
- Progress reporting

## Interface Design

### Core Client Class
```python
class BlowingOffClient:
    async def connect(self, server_url: str, auth_token: str)
    async def sync(self) -> SyncResult
    async def get_home(self) -> Home  # HomeKit-compatible naming
    async def update_characteristic(self, characteristic_id: str, value: Any)
    async def observe_changes(self, callback: Callable)
```

### Sync Result
```python
@dataclass
class SyncResult:
    synced_entities: int
    conflicts_resolved: int
    errors: List[SyncError]
    duration: float
```

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Local storage operations
- Sync protocol logic
- Conflict resolution algorithms
- State management

### Integration Tests
- Full sync cycles
- Concurrent client scenarios
- Network failure handling
- Large dataset synchronization

### Performance Tests
- Sync speed benchmarks
- Memory usage profiling
- Concurrent operation stress tests
- Large entity count scenarios

## Success Criteria

1. **Functional Parity**: All operations available in future Swift client
2. **Sync Reliability**: 100% data consistency after sync
3. **Performance**: <1s sync for typical home (300 entities)
4. **Offline Support**: Full functionality without server connection
5. **Test Coverage**: >90% code coverage with integration tests
