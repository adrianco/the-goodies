## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

1. **WildThing API Changes**
   - Pin to specific version
   - Comprehensive integration tests
   - Abstraction layer

2. **Performance Degradation**
   - Benchmark before/after
   - Profiling in each PR
   - Performance test suite

3. **Data Loss**
   - Backup before migration
   - Validation after migration
   - Rollback capability

### Process Risks

1. **Review Bottlenecks**
   - Multiple reviewers assigned
   - Domain expert backup
   - Clear review guidelines

2. **Integration Conflicts**
   - Small, focused PRs
   - Frequent rebasing
   - Clear dependencies

3. **Timeline Slippage**
   - Buffer in schedule
   - Parallel work streams
   - Regular progress tracking

## Conclusion

This PR strategy ensures a systematic, low-risk integration of WildThing into c11s-ios-house. By following this phased approach with small, focused PRs, we can maintain code quality, enable thorough testing, and provide a smooth migration path for users.
