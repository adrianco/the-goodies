## Smart Home Knowledge Graph Distributed MCP Library for Swift iOS and Python Backend

A standalone, reusable Swift/Python MCP server library optimized for knowledge graphs representing homes, rooms, devices, and their relationships. Uses the Inbetweenies protocol for distributed synchronization between WildThing (Swift) and FunkyGibbon (Python) components.

Naming scheme based on BBC TV comedy show The Goodies who had some "hit singles" in the 1970s, since Python is a reference to Monty Python... and lots of libraries have stupid names and I don't have anyone telling me what I can call things.
