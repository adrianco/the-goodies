# Blowing-Off Client Documentation Status

## Overview
All Python files in the `/workspaces/the-goodies/blowing-off` directory have been updated with comprehensive block comments following the requested format.

## Documentation Format Applied
Each file now includes:
1. **Development Context** - When/why the file was created and its role in the initiative
2. **Functionality** - What the file/module does
3. **Purpose** - Why it's needed in the system
4. **Known Issues** - Current bugs or limitations
5. **Revision History** - Timeline of changes
6. **Dependencies** - Key libraries and modules required
7. **Usage** - Example code showing how to use the module

## Key Themes in Documentation

### Inbetweenies Protocol
The documentation emphasizes that this is the Python reference implementation of the Inbetweenies protocol, which will guide the Swift/WildThing client development for Apple platforms.

### Offline-First Architecture
Multiple files highlight the offline-first design, where the client maintains a local SQLite database and syncs with the cloud when connectivity is available.

### Sync-Aware Operations
The repository pattern and base models ensure that all data mutations automatically track sync status, making it impossible to forget sync tracking.

### Conflict Resolution
The documentation explains the deterministic conflict resolution strategy (last-write-wins with tiebreaking) that ensures all clients reach the same conclusion independently.

### Known Limitations
Common issues documented across files include:
- Basic conflict resolution (no semantic merging)
- Single house assumption
- No encryption for local database
- Missing compression for sync payloads
- Limited bulk operation support

## Next Steps for Swift/WildThing Client
The documentation serves as a comprehensive guide for implementing the Swift client, highlighting:
1. Required data structures and their relationships
2. Sync protocol message formats
3. Conflict resolution logic that must be replicated
4. Repository pattern for data access
5. State management requirements
6. Error handling and retry strategies

All documentation is now in place to guide the future Swift/WildThing client implementation.
